Hi, I am Sujit Sarker here. I am interested in Software Quality Assurance(SQA). From my early age, I was very keen to know and learn about new technology. I always want to be there, where my learning process will be faster and can be continued. I'm confident that I have both high analytical ability and problem-solving skills, which are mostly suitable for an SQA Engineer, and because of that I have chosen this profession. I never compromise with quality and want to be a perfectionist in each step of my work, that is why accuracy is my first choice rather than other qualifications. I always try to fulfil all my responsibilities and duties through my dedication, sincerity and highest level of professionalism.

Overall, I have 10+ years of experience in an agile software development environment and have contributed as an QA and Project Manager.
